In this tutorial, we’ll be building Snapcat, the Snapchat for Cats. Using Vision’s new animal detector,
we’ll be able to detect cats, 
place the human filter on them, and take pictures of them. 
After taking pictures of our cats, we’ll want to scan their business cards. Using a brand new framework,
+VisionKit, we’ll be able to scan their business cards just like the default Notes app on iOS.

When being offline, it’s usually desirable to alter the user experience and update the user interface
in order to reflect the incapability of the app to perform network-based operations.

Animations are cool. They are an important part of iOS Human Interface Guidelines. 
Animations help you to draw user’s attention to important things or just add some fun to your app.
